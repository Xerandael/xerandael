He closes his eyes and allows his mind to feel for the forms as usual.

As in a dream, they come into view only roughly-hewn and full of inconsistencies.  This does not bother him anymore.  He's still searching.

A world of shadows and mists conjures itself around him and he takes it in.  He's being guided, always, yet never can he identify by whom.  The world takes him in and pulls him along pathways of imaginings and sketches from some untold mind.

Even as he opens his eyes again, he is driven to seek again.  How long has he had this affliction?

Eyes close.  Shadows.  Nameless feeling.  Sore body and thoughts with more vivid color but blurier details.

It takes a lot out of him.  Perhaps it keeps that portion of him within.  This chafes his psyche.  *I can't keep doing this forever.*

Again, his eyes shut.  Familiar sensations envelop him as unfamiliar shapes jostle into place and make themselves known.  He is only an observer in this land, having no form of his own.

Rapidly he writhes through the thickets and gnarls of an ancient black oak forest, the sky murky and ill-defined.  Nothing is defined till it needs to be.  His mind is but a lens.  As a dream holds only the items and space relevant to any given moment, the world he sees can only lend as much as his mind can take.  It is enough.

The pathways unfold.  The projection world builds itself around him, pieces assembling with no particular regard to geometric axioms.

Determined to break free, he fuses surrounding shadows into form of his own, projecting mental spirit into the ephemeral ether and demanding physical manifestation.

Ripples shudder through the astral plane.  The hidden mind has noticed his indolence.  Fleeting blurs shuffle around him.  He can't tell if they're monitoring him, mocking him, or something else.  What motivation drives this place?

His reveries are interrupted as branches twist and bend toward him and black lightning forms millions of seams in the air around him, tearing it apart.  The heart lies ahead.  The heart sends its brambles and arcs toward him.  A void protecting itself from the intruder it has lured inside.

Branch after branch swings toward him, lacerating and bludgeoning him as he slashes and kicks in return.  A tiring struggle ensues for minutes on end.

He finally plunges his dagger into the hollow electricity.  The seams shrivel and crack, as the air dissipates into the void.

The forms around him lose their essence and he is left alone.  He attempts to open his eyes, but cannot recall his mind back to the material plane.

He drifts, awaiting an encounter with another traveler.
