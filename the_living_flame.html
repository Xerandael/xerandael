  A fire spirit was born out of the primordial arcana and given physical form on the Earth.  He could expand as he consumed fuel or remain small as the flame of a single candle wick.
  One day he was captured by an evil alchemist, who sought to control and apply the unique, magically-enhanced heat of the spirit's combustion in pursuit of potions of greater and greater potency.  The alchemist lured the flame into a trap, with dry pine needles and other tasty consumables.  Once the flame was atop a large pile of flammable sundry, the alchemist hurled potions about with all the fury his six, spidery arms could manage, drenching all the land immediately around the flame with antimagic and wetness.
  Once the flame was so vulnerable, the alchemist approached with a torch of his own design, wherein he captured and contained the flame till he could bring it back to his tower.  The flame resisted, but could not hold out long as his fuel dwindled and his strength failed.  Ultimately he began to burn atop the torch, till he became but an ember ensnared within.
  Back at the tower, the alchemist abused the flame as the source of magical heat in all his potionmaking for untold years, embuing each potion with extra strength.  There were many alchemists in the land, but none could reckon how Eltera had achieved such mastery of the form.
  One day, a rogue of typically-ignoble origin spied from afar upon the tower.  When Eltera left for a weekly ingredient gathering, Zolnoa quickly dashed toward the door, smashed a potion of dispell magic upon it which she'd gained from a lesser alchemist, then picked the lock according to her own unique skills.  Once inside the tower, Zolnoa saw all wealth and manner of brews, her eyes opening wide.  She grabbed two vials of tempestuous, orange liquids, when a voice called to her.
  "Hey!  Who are you!?  Please help me!"
  Zolnoa spun around, startled and suspicious.
  "My name is Izgemad, I am the flame beneath the cauldron and I've been trapped here for 30 years."
  Zolnoa cautiously approached the cauldron and knelt down.  Sure enough, the fire below leaned toward her and spoke once more.  "Do you have any torches?  I could hop onto one."
