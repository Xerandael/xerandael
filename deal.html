<br/><br/><i>A frigid day in a Denny's parking lot.  Gene and Lou stand together waiting.</i>

<p>
<b>Lou</b><br/>
We're teachers, Gene!  Not drug dealers!<br/>
I'm a speech and debate teacher!  I should've known better than to listen to you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Gene</b><br/>
Do you want your students sharing pencils, Lou!?<br/>
Nobody buys shit at the bake sale anymore!  We're lucky I'm a chemistry teacher and that Tessa in 3rd period knew how to make meth!
</p>

<br/><br/><i>Sam and Rick walk onto stage and stand facing Gene and Lou from 10ft away.</i>

<p>
<b>Sam</b><br/>
So you're the 2 nerds.  Let's see the product.
</p>

<p>
<b>Gene</b><br/>
Ohhh... how are we gonna trust each other?<br/>
This is some complicated game theory shit.<br/>
...<br/>
How do we know one side isn't going to cheat the other?<br/>
...</br>
Maybe we could exchange some gifts first as a trust exercise.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rick</b><br/>
Ey!?  Who the fuck is this guy?  You got the goods or no!?
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam</b><br/>
Alright, look.  I know we don't trust each other.  But this ain't no barbie tea party.
</p>

<p>
<b>Gene</b><br/>
Uhh.  Okay okay.  How about this.<br/>
I'll put the drugs on the ice.  You put the money.  We shove them across at the same time.<br/>
That way, we can each make sure that the other has sent their part before we get ours.
</p>

<i>Gene lines up a shove across the ice</i>

<p>
<b>Lou</b><br/>
Woaaah, waaait.  Someone still has to send it out first.  What if we push the drugs across the ice and they don't send the money?
</p>

<p>
<b>Rick</b><br/>
What the fuck, man!?  Let's just make the swap and go!
</p>

<i>Lou and Rick both shove the packages across the ice, but both only travel a short distance</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>Comic sequence of slipping and falling retrieving the packages</i>

<p>
<b>Gene</b><br/>
Okay, okay.  How about this.  Lou will bring you half the drugs.  Then you bring half the money.<br/>
Then Lou will bring you a quarter of the drugs.  Then you bring a quarter of the money.<br/>
Then Lou will bring you an eigth of the drugs.  Then you bring an eighth of the money ---
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam</b><br/>
--- That'll take forever!
</p>

<p>
<b>Gene</b><br/>
-- Unless we could somehow move faster and faster at each step, which would therefore allow for a finite sum.  But how can we move faster?<br/>
*BEAT -- Eyes the drugs -- Shakes head*<br/>
Okay okay, how about this.  I'll hide the drugs.  You hide the money.  We each set up a chain of clues leading to the packages ---
</p>

<i>Rick pulls out a gun</i>

<p>
<b>Rick</b><br/>
--- WAIT, WHAT.  NO.  WE ARE NOT DOING THIS.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lou</b><br/>
Look!  I'm a speech and debate teacher!  I can resolve this tension.<br/>
Alright, alright.  How about this.  You shoot Sam, then yourself, then Gene, then me.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rick</b><br/>
..? Fine.  Okay.  This is insane.
</p>

<i>BANG BANG.  Sam and Rick drop.  Gene and Lou run.</i>
